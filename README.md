- The work that I did on this project was to implement a way for the pirate to reach the treasure. That required me to map out there possible route as well as ensuring they take the best route to the loot. The code I created was the logic behind the pirate movving. I was provided with the priates starter location.

- Computer scientists use technology to answer problems most don't know about. The reason why it matters so much is they can range from space exploration to the medtech section of computer science. 

* The way I approach problems is by first replicating them to see how the problem occured. That can vary from a wide range of trial and error or using dev tools in the browser.
*  My ethical responsibilities are to make sure the end user's information is protected as well as organizations. Another responsibility I have would be to ensure they have a seamless user experience and little to no bugs.
